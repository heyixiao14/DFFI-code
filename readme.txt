This is the code for the paper "Interpreting Deep Forest through Feature Contribution and MDI Feature Importance".

1. Feature Contribution (A Regression Example):
example/example_bikesharingcontribution.py generates a '.csv' file (under the 'record' folder) listing each sample's feature and the corresponding feature contribution. 

2. Feature Importance (A Regression Example):
example/example_bikesharingimpt.py outputs the feature importance, generating bikesharingimpt.pdf under the 'record' folder.

3. A Classification Example:
example/example_classification.py computes feature contribution and feature importance for a synthetic 3-class problem, generating a feature importance plot '3classimpt.pdf' under the 'record' folder.

4. A General Demo:
example/demo_df.py provides the simplest demo to compute feature contribution and feature importance for deep forests.
